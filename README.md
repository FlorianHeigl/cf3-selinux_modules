This is a simple CFengine 3 module to install local SELinux modules.
It deploys the module source, then builds and inserts the module.  I
wrote about it here:

It's based on the approach taken by the SANS Institute in their puppet
modules (https://github.com/sansnoc/puppet). Thanks to them very much for
their generosity in sharing.  This implementation, such as it is, is
released under the MIT license; see LICENSE.txt for details.
